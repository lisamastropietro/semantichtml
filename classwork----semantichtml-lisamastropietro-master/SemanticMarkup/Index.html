<!-- description -->
<p>Hi, this is my super awesome fun web page where the content makes no sense
     but there is a lot of it. 
     So let's get into some business that you can learn from.</p>

<h2> Sometimes people say important things</h2> 
<!-- description of next section -->
<p> You need to document important things that people say so you can sound smart when it's necessary.</p>

<h2>When it comes to HTML, there are some things you just shouldn't do</h2> 
<!-- description -->
<p> At least, not anymore...</p>

<h4>Want bold text?</h4>
<!-- make 'right way' bold first the wrong way, then the right way -->
<p>There's a wrong way and a right way. Always use the right way!</p>

<!-- title for next item -->
Maybe you need some italics?
<!-- make 'like this' italic using the wrong method. Make 'right way' italic using the correct method -->
Again, it used to be done like this. This is wrong. This is the right way.

Separation of concerns
<!-- description -->
The wrong way tags above are deprecated and should not be used. HTML should be used to mark-up or organize your content. It should not be used to style your content or interact with it. Those are the jobs of CSS and JavaScript!

Links
<!-- make either 'place' in the next body of text a link to your favorite site. (keep it appropriate) -->
Links are one of the most important parts of the web. They help you navigate from place to place on the internet.

Sections
<!-- go back through and group each section correctly
     stretch: give each group a class that properly reflects what they represent -->
Section elements are good for grouping elements that belong together. You can also use div's for this
